  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>We respect your privacy. The following text describes our policies
  for collecting and handling data.  If you have any questions, please
  <a href="{%url healthdb.views.contact%}">contact us</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
  
  <p>Like most website operators, health-db.appspot.com ("Health Database") collects
  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
  servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
  request. Health Database's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
  information is to better understand how Health Database's visitors use its
  website. From time to time, Health Database may release
  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  
  <p>Health Database also collects potentially personally-identifying
  information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Health Database does not
  use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
  disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that
  it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described
  below.</p>
  
  <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  
  <p>Certain visitors to Health Database’s websites choose to interact with
  Health Database in ways that require Health Database to gather
  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
  that Health Database gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 
  Health Database collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
  appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
  Health Database. Health Database does not disclose personally-identifying
  information other than as described below. And visitors can always
  refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
  that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
  activities. </p>
  
  <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
  
  <p>Health Database may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors
  to its websites. 
  
  Health Database may display this information
  publicly or provide it to others. However, Health Database does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
  
  <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  
  <p>Health Database discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on Health Database’s behalf or to provide
  services available at Health Database’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed
  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
  affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
  using Health Database, you consent to the transfer of such
  information to them. Health Database will not rent or sell potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
  Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
  as described above, Health Database discloses potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
  required to do so by law, or when Health Database believes in good faith that
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  Health Database, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
  registered user of Health Database and have supplied your email
  address, Health Database may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
  new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
  what’s going on with Health Database. If you send us a request
  (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
  we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
  respond to your request or to help us support other users. Health Database
  takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
  unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
  
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
  visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
  website each time the visitor returns. Health Database uses cookies to help
  Health Database identify and track visitors, their usage of Health Database
  website, and their website access preferences. Health Database visitors who
  do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
  browsers to refuse cookies before using Health Database, with the
  drawback that certain features of Health Database’s website may not function
  properly without the aid of cookies. </p>
  
  <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
  
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Health Database may
  change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Health Database’s sole
  discretion. Health Database encourages visitors to frequently check this page
  for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site
  after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance
  of such change.</p>
